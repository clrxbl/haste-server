# Haste

Haste works really well with a little utility called
[haste-client](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-client), allowing you
to do things like:

`cat something | haste`

which will output a URL to share containing the contents of `cat something`'s
STDOUT.  Check the README there for more details and usages.

## Installation

1.  Download the package, and expand it
2.  Explore the settings inside of config.js, but the defaults should be good
3.  `yarn install`
4.  `yarn start`

## Settings

* `host` - the host the server runs on (default localhost)
* `port` - the port the server runs on (default 7777)
* `keyLength` - the length of the keys to user (default 10)
* `maxLength` - maximum length of a paste (default 400000)
* `staticMaxAge` - max age for static assets (86400)
* `recompressStaticAssets` - whether or not to compile static js assets (true)
* `documents` - static documents to serve (ex: http://hastebin.com/about.com)
  in addition to static assets.  These will never expire.
* `storage` - storage options (see below)
* `logging` - logging preferences
* `keyGenerator` - key generator options (see below)
* `rateLimits` - settings for rate limiting (see below)

## Rate Limiting

When present, the `rateLimits` option enables built-in rate limiting courtesy
of `connect-ratelimit`.  Any of the options supported by that library can be
used and set in `config.json`.

See the README for [connect-ratelimit](https://github.com/dharmafly/connect-ratelimit)
for more information!

## Key Generation

### Phonetic

Attempts to generate phonetic keys, similar to `pwgen`

``` json
{
  "type": "phonetic"
}
```

## Storage

### Redis

To use redis storage you must install the `redis` package in npm, and have
`redis-server` running on the machine.

`npm install redis`

Once you've done that, your config section should look like:

``` json
{
  "type": "redis",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 6379,
  "db": 2
}
```

You can also set an `expire` option to the number of seconds to expire keys in.
This is off by default, but will constantly kick back expirations on each view
or post.

All of which are optional except `type` with very logical default values.

If your Redis server is configured for password authentification, use the `password` field.
